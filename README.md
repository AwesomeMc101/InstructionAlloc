# InstructionAlloc
Simple way of maybe learning a bit more about how memory looks by just allocating and deallocating with this. Code is well-noted and easy to use.

## Commands
* REQUEST arrayName intCount -> new arrayName with intCount*sizeof(int) bytes
* FREE arrayName -> free arrayName
* PRINT arrayName -> print every value in arrayName
* WRITE arrayName 0 500 -> set 0th idx of arrayName to 500
* READ arrayName 0 -> read the 0th idx of arrayName
